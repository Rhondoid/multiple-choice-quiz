# multiple-choice-quiz
This repo features an interactive multiple-choice quiz.

The program was built to build and progress my Javascript skills.


## Usage

Click the start button to begin quiz. Answer each question correctly will progress you to the next question until you finish all questions. Each incorrect question will decrease the timer by 10 seconds. Keep playing until you win or the timer runs out.
